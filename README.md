# OLua

OLua is a front end of Lua with a serial of new language features. A type system is incorprated including class, interface, enum and explict intrinsic types. Then type validation is more strict as well. The code is compiled into original Lua and runs in Lua virtual machine. 

As this is a very preliminary version, there is still much work to complete. Please leave me your comments and suggestions and I will appreciate.
